### 🐹 Hamster Tower Game

Hamster Tower Game is a cute and physics-based stacking game built with React and Matter.js.
Your goal is simple: stack as many hamsters as you can without letting them fall!
Each hamster drops from above, bouncing and sliding with realistic physics —
but be careful! If one of them touches the ground (or wall) out of order... Game Over! 💥

###  🎮 Gameplay Overview

- 🧱 Stack Hamsters: Hamsters fall one by one. Position them carefully to build a tall and stable tower.
- 🧲 Physics-Based Motion: Powered by Matter.js, each hamster reacts naturally to gravity, friction, and collisions.
- 📷 Dynamic Camera: The camera smoothly moves upward as your tower grows, keeping the full stack in view.

### 🐾 Simple Controls:

- Left / Right Arrow keys → Move hamster horizontally
- Down Arrow / Spacebar → Drop hamster faster
- Mobile: Tap left/right side of the screen to move and drop

### Let's play!
