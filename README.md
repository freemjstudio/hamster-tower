### 🐹 Hamster Tower Game

Hamster Tower Game is a cute and physics-based stacking game built with React and Matter.js.
Your goal is simple: stack as many hamsters as you can without letting them fall!
Each hamster drops from above, bouncing and sliding with realistic physics —
but be careful! If one of them touches the ground (or wall) out of order... Game Over! 💥
